## Hi there 👋

I'm a fourth year student, and casual academic at the **UNSW Sydney**. I'm currently working on code to further my understanding of course content covered throughout my degree thus far. I'm currently learning **html**, **css**, **javascript** and **MATLAB**. All of which are relevant to my degree and/or additional side projects that I am completing in my own time. 

### Developing Projects
- **Personal Website**: I am attempting to convert my resume into a personal website using the skills learnt in COMP6080 at UNSW. 💻
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: I am currently working through the various search algorithms and relevant data structures to further my understanding of the concepts learnt in COMP2521 at UNSW. 🔎
- **Educational Tools**: I am working to develop some software to improve the studying process (private). 📚

### Developed Projects
- **Hand Gesture Robot**: Created an automated robot capable of moving via registered hand movements. 🤖
- **Sudoku Solver**: Simple program that uses a BFS algorithm to solve sudoku puzzles of all sizes. 🧩
