## Hey there 👋

I am a casual academic and final-year student studying Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering at **UNSW Sydney**. Most of my recent contributions relate to my [thesis project](https://github.com/nathansivalingam/mechanical-engineering-thesis-c/blob/main/z5359644_thesis_c.pdf?raw=true), where I am investigating the use of vortex generators as a method of cooling photovoltaic modules. 🌱

### Developing Projects
- As a Research Assistant, I develop models for augmented reality applications aimed at enhancing the teaching of mechanical design concepts to university students. 🌏
- As an Academic Demonstrator for the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering at UNSW, I guide students through individual and group engineering tasks, deliver live problem-solving demonstrations, and respond to technical and non-technical questions on course forums. ✍️

### Developed Projects
- [Park Pilot](https://github.com/nathansivalingam/park-pilot) &#8594; I worked in a team to develop a smart vehicle parking management system as part of my final computer science project at UNSW. 🚙
- [Engineering Portfolio](https://engineering-portfolio-website.vercel.app/) &#8594; I developed an engineering portfolio in the form of a website for both my computer science and mechanical engineering projects to aid in the internship application process. 💻
- [Hand Gesture Robot](https://github.com/nathansivalingam/hand-gesture-robot) &#8594; I worked in a team to create an automated robot capable of moving via registered hand movements. 🦾
- As an Academic Demonstrator, I created public repositories with interactive formulae. These repos are designed to help students check their solutions to complex problems and find mistakes quickly, thanks to a step-by-step guide. Public repositories are available for the following UNSW taught courses 📚
  - [Mechanics of Solids 2](https://github.com/nathansivalingam/mechanics-of-solids-2-demo) &#8594; (MMAN3400) 🍎
  - [Space Systems Architecture](https://github.com/nathansivalingam/space-systems-architecture-matlab) &#8594; (AERO9500) 🚀
