## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth year student, and casual academic at the **University of New South Wales**. I'm currently working on code to further my understanding of course content covered throughout my degree thus far. I'm currently learning **html**, **css**, **javascript** and **MATLAB**. All of which are relevant to my degree and/or additional side projects that I am completing in my own time.

### Developing Projects
- Personal Website: I am attempting to convert my resume into a personal website using the skills learnt in COMP6080 at UNSW.
- Data Structures and Algorithms: I am currently working through the various search algorithms and relevant data structures to further my understanding of the concepts learnt in COMP2521 at UNSW.
- Educational Tools: I am working to develop some software to improve the studying process (private).
