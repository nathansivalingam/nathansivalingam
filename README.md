## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth year student, and casual academic at the **University of New South Wales**. I'm currently working on code to further my understanding of course content covered throughout my degree thus far. I'm currently learning **html**, **css**, **javascript** and **MATLAB**. All of which are relevant to my degree and/or additional side projects that I am completing in my own time.

Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn :iphone:
