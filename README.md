## Hey there 👋

I'm a casual academic and final-year student studying computer science and mechanical engineering at **UNSW Sydney**. Recently, the majority of my contributions are related to my [thesis project](https://github.com/nathansivalingam/mechanical-engineering-thesis-c) where I am working to test vortex generators as a method of cooling photovoltaic modules. 🌱

### Developed Projects
- [Park Pilot](https://github.com/nathansivalingam/mechanical-engineering-thesis-c/blob/main/z5359644_thesis_c.pdf) &#8594; I worked in a team to develop a smart vehicle parking management system as part of my final computer science project at UNSW. 🚗
- [Personal Website](https://nathan-personal-website.vercel.app/) &#8594; I converted my resume into a personal website using the skills learnt in COMP6080 at UNSW. 💻
- [Hand Gesture Robot](https://github.com/nathansivalingam/hand-gesture-robot) &#8594; I created an automated robot capable of moving via registered hand movements. ⚙️
- [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/nathansivalingam/sudoku-solver) &#8594; I coded a simple program that uses a BFS algorithm to solve sudoku puzzles of all sizes. 🧩
- Educational Tools &#8594; I am creating public repositories with interactive formulae. These repos are designed to help students check their solutions to complex problems and find mistakes quickly, thanks to a step-by-step guide. Public repositories are available for the following UNSW taught courses 📚
  - [Mechanics of Solids 2](https://github.com/nathansivalingam/mechanics-of-solids-2-demo) &#8594; (MMAN3400) 🍎
  - [Space Systems Architecture](https://github.com/nathansivalingam/space-systems-architecture-matlab) &#8594; (AERO9500) 🚀

### Developing Projects
- I'm currently investigating the enhancement of photovoltaic modules through improvements made to natural and forced convection. ☀️
- [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/nathansivalingam/sorting-algorithms) &#8594; I am currently working through the various search algorithms and relevant data structures to further my understanding of the concepts learnt in COMP2521 at UNSW. 🔎
